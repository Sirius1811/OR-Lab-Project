# OR-Lab-Project
As a contribution to Group-11's Operations Research Lab Project for the Spring Semester of the Session 2022-23, this Github Repository has been created.

The project focuses on addressing the following problem statement: Maersk, a prominent global shipping company, operates its primary port depot in Copenhagen. The challenge involves delivering goods from Copenhagen to 20 different locations around the world, which have been marked on a plot. To efficiently complete their trips and return to the depot, three operational ships are available. The primary objective is to minimize the distance traveled by each ship and obtain the corresponding trips, visualizing them for further analysis.
